If input is not of the form $\Sigma^* \# \Sigma^*$, accept, which can be done using a DFA, which can be encoded in the finite control of the Turing machine

The description of turing machine $N$ (non deterministic) is as follows 

$N$ = 
``
On input $z$,
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Scan the entire input from left to right(in the read only tape), and then come back to left end marker while simulating the DFA which accepts $\Sigma^* \# \Sigma^*$. If DFA rejects, accept $z$
    \item Now input is of the form $z = x\#y$
    \item Move input tape head and working tape head till simultaneously till the input tape head reaches the end of input
    \item Now move the input tape head back to \#
    \item Move input tape head and working tape head towards left till input reaches left end marker
    \item If $|x| = |y|$, then working tape head would have reached \#. Hence if working tape head is at a cell having some other symbol, Accept (since $|x| != |y|$ \imp $x\#y \in \overline{L}$
    \item Now we have verified $z = x\#y$ and $|x| = |y|$, if $|x| != |y|$, there exists a position $i$ wherein $x_i != y_i$.
    \item Move the input tape head and working tape head simultaneously till input tape head reaches \#. After that move back the input tape head to left end marker.
    \item Now input tape head is at left end marker and working tape head is at \#. 
    \item Move the input tape head and working tape head towards right simultaneously.
    \item Non deterministically choose when to stop
    \item if the symbol in cell at the input tape head is not the same as symbol in the cell at the work tape head, Accept (since we have found a position at which both strings $x$ and $y$ differ)
\end{enumerate}

The claim $N$ accepts $\overline{L}$ is immediate (every step in the description of $N$ has the corresponding reason)\\
Note that we are not in anyways using a counter to track where we are. We are only using the heads of 2 tapes in a certain way so as to do the same job as counter. And thus we are not using any space for writing
