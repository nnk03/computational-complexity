To prove : $\phi$ is satisfiable if and only if the above algorithm finds a satisfying assignment
\begin{proof}
    If $\phi$ is unsatisfiable, then no turing machine whose language is $\SAT$ will output a satisfying assignment\\
    \imp
    $\phi$ is unsatisfiable \imp Algorithm won't find a satisfying assignment\\

    
\end{proof}
