$\NP \subseteq \P^{\NP}$ is always true.

Let $L \in \NP$, the following is a turing machine $M^{L}$ using $L$ as an oracle and accepting $L$ in polynomial time

$M$ = ``\\
On input $x$,
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Query the oracle if $x \in L$.
    \item accept if and only if oracle says yes
\end{enumerate}

Correctness is trivial since the oracle always gives correct responses and the oracle is the same language which we want to accept and the machine runs in polynomial time

Thus $L(M^L) = L$, thus $L \in \P^{\NP}$.


It is not known if $\P^\NP \subseteq \NP$ is true or not.
