\begin{enumerate}
    \item[(a)]
    
    This is false, because, let $L_1 = \phi$ and $L_2 = HP$, we know that $L_1$ is decidable whereas $L_2$ is not decidable, (and also $L_1 \subseteq L_2$)

    $L_2 \not \lem L_1$ because if $L_2 \lem L_1$, then $L_2 = HP$ would have been decidable, which we know it is not the case

    \item[(b)]
    This is also false, because, let $L_1 = HP$ and $L_2 = \Sigma^*$

    $L_1 \subseteq L_2$ and $L_1$ is undecidable and $L_2$ is decidable

    $L_1 \not \lem L_2$ because if $L_1 \lem L_2$, then $L_1 = HP$ would have been decidable, which we know it is not the case
