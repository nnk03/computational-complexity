$
L = \{
    M \mid L(M) \text{ is not regular}
\}
$

is a property of SD language

If there are 2 machines $M_1$ and $M_2$ accepting the same language, then it cannot be the case that $L(M_1)$ is regular and $L(M_2)$ is not regular

This is non trivial since there are turing machines which accept regular languages and turing machines which accept non-regular languages

This is also non-monotone since, there exists $L_1, L_2$ such that $L_1 \subseteq L_2$ and $\calp(L_1) = 1$ and 
$\calp(L_2) = 0$

$L_2 = \Sigma^* $ and $L_1 = \{
    0^n1^n \mid n \geq 0
\}$

here $L_1$ is not regular which satisfies the property whereas $L_2$ is regular and a strict superset of $L_1$ which does not satisfy the property

Since the property is non-trivial, by Rice's Theorem 1, $L$ is not decidable

Since the property is non-monotone, by Rice's Theorem 2,
$L$ is not semi-decidable
