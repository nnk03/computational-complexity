The language is 

$
L = \{
    M \mid L(M) \in \pii{42}
\}
$

This is a property of language since it cannot be the case that there exists $M_1, M_2$ accepting the same language but $L(M_1) \in \pii{42}$ and $L(M_2) \notin \pii{42}$ or vice-versa

This is non-trivial because there exists turing machines accepting $L \in \pii{42}$ and turing machines accepting languages $L \notin \pii{42}$

Hence this is undecidable by Rice's Theorem 1

This is also non-monotone because, let $L_1 \in \pii{42}$ and 
$L_2 \in \pii{43} \setminus \pii{42}$ 

$\calp(L_1) = 1$ and $\calp(L_1 \cup L_2) = 0$ since union of $L_1$ and $L_2$ cannot be in $\pii{42}$ since $L_2$ is in $\pii{43} \setminus \pii{42}$
