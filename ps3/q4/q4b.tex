$
L = \{
    M \mid \exists L' \subseteq \Sigma^*, L' \not = \phi \text{ and}
    L' \subseteq L(M)
\}
$

This is equivalent to saying 
$
L = \{
    M \mid L(M) \text{ is not empty}
\}
$
because

$L(M)$ is not empty

\imp
$\exists L' \subseteq L(M)$ which is $L(M)$ itself, such that $L' \subseteq L(M)$ i.e $L' = L(M)$

$
\exists L' \subseteq \Sigma^*, L' \not = \phi \text{ and}
    L' \subseteq L(M)
    $

\imp
$L(M)$ is not empty

$L(M)$ is not empty is a property of SD languages since
if there exists 2 machines $M_1$ and $M_2$ accepting the same language, it cannot be the case that 

$L(M_1) = \phi$ and $L(M_2) \not = \phi$ or vice-versa


This is a non-trivial property, since there are turing machines accepting empty languages and there are turing machines accepting non-empty languages

This is a monotone property because

$\forall L_1, L_2 \in \Sigma^*, \calp(L_1) = 1 \Rightarrow \calp(L_2) = 1$

because if $L_1$ is non-empty, any superset of $L_1$ will be non-empty

Since, this property is non-trivial, by Rice's theorem 1, the given language is undecidable

We cannot conclude anything about semi-decidability from Rice's Theorem 2 because the language is not non-monotone
