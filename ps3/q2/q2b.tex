To prove :
\[
    \di{i} = \{
        L \mid \exists A \in \s{i - 1} \text{ such that $L$ is decidable in $A$}
    \}
\]

or

\[
    \s{i} \cap \pii{i} = \{
        L \mid \exists A \in \s{i - 1} \text{ such that $L$ is decidable in $A$}
    \}
\]

Let $L$ be such that $\exists A \in \s{i - 1}$ such that $L$ is decidable in $A$

\imp
$
L \in \{
    L \mid \exists A \in \s{i - 1} \text{ such that $L$ is decidable in $A$}
\}
$

\imp
$L$ is semidecidable in $A$, (decidable languages are trivially semidecidable)

\imp
$L \in \s{i}$

From the previous question we proved that $D^A = \sd^A \cap \cosd^A$

\imp
Since $L$ is decidable in $A$, both $L$ and $\ovl{L}$ are semidecidable in $A$

\imp
$L \in \pii{i}$

hence $L \in \s{i}$ and $L \in \pii{i}$

\imp
$L \in \s{i} \cap \pii{i}$


Now let $L \in \s{i} \cap \pii{i}$, we have to prove that $L \in \di{i}$


$L \in \s{i}$

\imp
$\exists A \in \s{i - 1}$ such that $L$ is semidecidable in $A$

\imp
$\exists$ an OTM $N^A$ accepting $L$

$L \in \pii{i}$

\imp
$\exists B \in \s{i - 1}$ such that $\ovl{L}$ is semidecidable in $B$

\imp
$\exists$ an OTM $N^B$ accepting $\ovl{L}$
