To prove :
\[
    \di{i} = \{
        L \mid \exists A \in \s{i - 1} \text{ such that $L$ is decidable in $A$}
    \}
\]

or

\[
    \s{i} \cap \pii{i} = \{
        L \mid \exists A \in \s{i - 1} \text{ such that $L$ is decidable in $A$}
    \}
\]

Let $L$ be such that $\exists A \in \s{i - 1}$ such that $L$ is decidable in $A$

\imp
$
L \in \{
    L \mid \exists A \in \s{i - 1} \text{ such that $L$ is decidable in $A$}
\}
$

\imp
$L$ is semidecidable in $A$, (decidable languages are trivially semidecidable)

\imp
$L \in \s{i}$

From the previous question we proved that $D^A = \sd^A \cap \cosd^A$

\imp
Since $L$ is decidable in $A$, both $L$ and $\ovl{L}$ are semidecidable in $A$

\imp
$L \in \pii{i}$

hence $L \in \s{i}$ and $L \in \pii{i}$

\imp
$L \in \s{i} \cap \pii{i}$


Now let $L \in \s{i} \cap \pii{i}$, we have to prove that $L \in \di{i}$


$L \in \s{i}$

\imp
$\exists A \in \s{i - 1}$ such that $L$ is semidecidable in $A$

\imp
$\exists$ an OTM $N^A$ accepting $L$

$L \in \pii{i}$

\imp
$\exists B \in \s{i - 1}$ such that $\ovl{L}$ is semidecidable in $B$

\imp
$\exists$ an OTM $N^B$ accepting $\ovl{L}$

Now let machine $M'$ be as follows

$M'$ =
``

On input $x$,
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Run $N^A$ and $N^B$ on $x$ with time sharing, with using oracle $A$ for queries of type $x \in A$ and using oracle $B$ for queries of type $x \in B$
    \item If $N^A$ accepts, accept
    \item If $N^B$ accepts, reject
\end{enumerate}

''

$M'$ is total because for all $x \in \Sigma^*$, $x \in L$ or $x \in \ovl{L}$

\imp
$x$ is accepted by $N^A$ or $x$ is accepted by $N^B$

\imp
$M'$ either accepts $x$ or $M'$ rejects $x$

\imp
$M'$ is total

$L = L(M')$

$x \in L$

\imp
$x \in L(N^A)$

\imp
$N^A$ accepts $x$

\imp
$M'$ accepts $x$


$x \notin L$

\imp
$x \in \ovl{L}$

\imp
$x \in L(N^B)$

\imp
$N^B$ accepts $x$

\imp
$M'$ rejects $x$

\imp
$x \notin L(M')$



Hence $L(M') = L$

And thus we have showed that $L$ is decidable in $A$ and $B$

Hence $L \in \Delta_i$
