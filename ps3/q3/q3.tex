\textbf{Claim 1} : $\s{i}$ closed under union \imp
$\pii{i}$ closed under intersection

\textbf{Claim 2} : $\s{i}$ closed under intersection \imp
$\pii{i}$ closed under union

Proof of Claim 1 : 


$\s{i}$ closed under union

\imp
$\forall L_1, L_2 \in \s{i}, L_1 \cup L_2 \in \s{i}$

\imp
$\forall L_1, L_2 \in \s{i}, \ovl{(\ovl{L_1} \cap \ovl{L_2})} \in \s{i}$, by De Morgan's Law

\imp
$\forall \ovl{L_1}, \ovl{L_2} \in \pii{i}, {(\ovl{L_1} \cap \ovl{L_2})} \in \pii{i}$

\imp
$\forall L_1', L_2' \in \pii{i}, {(L_1' \cap L_2')} \in \pii{i}$

\imp
$\pii{i}$ closed under intersection

Proof of Claim 2 : 


$\s{i}$ closed under intersection

\imp
$\forall L_1, L_2 \in \s{i}, L_1 \cap L_2 \in \s{i}$

\imp
$\forall L_1, L_2 \in \s{i}, \ovl{(\ovl{L_1} \cup \ovl{L_2})} \in \s{i}$, by De Morgan's Law

\imp
$\forall \ovl{L_1}, \ovl{L_2} \in \pii{i}, {(\ovl{L_1} \cup \ovl{L_2})} \in \pii{i}$

\imp
$\forall L_1', L_2' \in \pii{i}, {(L_1' \cup L_2')} \in \pii{i}$

\imp
$\pii{i}$ closed under union

Suffices to prove

$\s{i}$ is closed under intersection and union

We'll argue using induction

\textbf{Base case} : $i = 0$
$\s{0} = \Delta_0 = \Delta_1$ which is the set of decidable languages and we already know that decidable languages are closed under union and intersection

\textbf{Strong Induction Hypothesis}
The below statement is true for all $i \leq n$
$$
\s{i} \text{ is closed under intersection and union}
$$
The below statement also follows from Claim 1 and claim 2
$$
\pii{i} \text{ is closed under intersection and union}
$$

Therefore we can consider both statements as Strong induction Hypothesis

\textbf{To prove for $i = n + 1$}

Let $L_1, L_2 \in \s{n + 1}$

\imp
$\exists A \in \pii{n}, A \subseteq \Sigma^* \times \Sigma^*, x \in L_1 \Leftrightarrow \exists y_1, (x, y_1) \in A$ and

$\exists B \in \pii{n}, B \subseteq \Sigma^* \times \Sigma^*, x \in L_2 \Leftrightarrow \exists y_2, (x, y_2) \in B$

% \imp
% $\exists N^{\ovl{A}}$ accepting $L_1$ and 
% $\exists N^{\ovl{B}}$ accepting $L_2$

\imp
$\exists (A \cup B) \in \pii{n}$ (by induction hypothesis) such that 

$
x \in L_1 \cup L_2 \Leftrightarrow \exists y, (x, y) \in (A \cup B)$

\imp
$L_1 \cup L_2 \in \pii{n + 1}$

and thus proved $\s{n + 1}$ is closed under union which proves $\pii{n + 1}$ is closed under intersection from the claims

Let $L_1, L_2 \in \s{n + 1}$

\imp
$\exists A \in \pii{n}, A \subseteq \Sigma^* \times \Sigma^*, x \in L_1 \Leftrightarrow \exists y_1, (x, y_1) \in A$ and

$\exists B \in \pii{n}, B \subseteq \Sigma^* \times \Sigma^*, x \in L_2 \Leftrightarrow \exists y_2, (x, y_2) \in B$

% \imp
% $\exists N^{\ovl{A}}$ accepting $L_1$ and 
% $\exists N^{\ovl{B}}$ accepting $L_2$

\imp
$\exists (A \cap B) \in \pii{n}$ (by induction hypothesis) such that 

$
x \in L_1 \cap L_2 \Leftrightarrow \exists y, (x, y) \in (A \cap B)$

\imp
$L_1 \cap L_2 \in \pii{n + 1}$


and thus proved $\s{n + 1}$ is closed under intersection which proves $\pii{n + 1}$ is closed under union from the claims

therefore we have proved that if the statement holds for all $i \leq n$, it holds for $i = n + 1$

and thus by principle of mathematical induction it is proved that 

$$
\forall i \in \N, \s{i} \text{ and } \pii{i} \text{ are closed under union and intersection}
$$
